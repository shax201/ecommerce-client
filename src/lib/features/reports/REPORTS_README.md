## Usage Examples

### Generate a Sales Report
```typescript
import { generateReportWithCacheInvalidation } from "@/actions/reports";

const reportData = {
  type: "sales",
  format: "pdf",
  filters: {
    dateRange: {
      start: "2024-01-01",
      end: "2024-01-31",
    },
  },
  includeCharts: true,
  includeDetails: true,
};

const result = await generateReportWithCacheInvalidation(reportData);
```

### Get Reports with Filters
```typescript
import { useGetReportsQuery } from "@/lib/features/reports";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useGetReportsQuery({
  type: "sales",
  status: "completed",
  search: "monthly",
  page: 1,
  limit: 10,
});
```

### Download Report
```typescript
import { downloadReportWithCacheInvalidation } from "@/actions/reports";

const result = await downloadReportWithCacheInvalidation("report_123");
if (result.success) {
  // Handle download
  window.open(result.data.downloadUrl);
}
```

## State Management

### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
interface ReportsState {
  currentReport: ReportData | null;
  isGenerating: boolean;
  generationProgress: number;
  filters: {
    type: ReportType | 'all';
    status: string;
    dateRange: { start: string; end: string };
    search: string;
  };
  pagination: { page: number; limit: number; total: number };
  selectedReports: string[];
  templates: ReportTemplate[];
  exportOptions: ExportOptions;
}
```
